## Requirements

- Linux server with installed and configured web server including https (WebXR requires https)
- Python 3 installed
- FFMPEG installed (required if thumbnails generator will be used)

## Setup

### Using JSON solution and provided Python scripts

- Edit `config.ini` providing correct paths

    `videos_location` => absolute path to folder containing videos folder and thumbnails folder (eg. for  `/media/videos` set this to `videos_location=/media/videos`)
  
    `videos_folder` => main folder where videos are located (eg. for /media/videos/vr set this to `videos_folder=vr`)
  
    `thumbnails_folder` => main folder where Thumbnails are located (eg. for /media/videos/thumbnails set this to `thumbnails_folder=thumbnails`)
  
    `videos_relative_path` => this is relative path from player folder to videos folder, must be inside www folder (eg. player is in `/var/www/html/web_vr_player` your videos are available via symlink from `/var/www/html/videos` then set this to `videos_relative_path=../videos`)
  
    To create symlink => 
        
        cd /var/www/html/
        ln /media/videos videos

- Make `init.sh` file executable `chmod u+x init.sh` and run it. This script downloads ini parser for bash
- If you don't have Thumbnails generated for your videos and want to use them run `generate_thumbnails.sh` script
- Finally run `generate_files_json.sh` script to generate `files.json` containing list of VR files for player

Script can set screen type based on file name. Add one of following at the end of file name: `_TB` (Top-Bottom), `_SCREEN`. Default screen type is Side-by-Side.

### Stashapp

For stashapp comment json span in index and uncomment stashapp span, then provide url to app (it must be configured with SSL, browser will blocking mixed content if you use http)

Tag your videos with one of these tags: `SBS`, `VR` (screen type is SBS), `TB`, `SCREEN`

Videos are organized by Studios.

## Generating your own JSON file with video sources
Player is using locally stored JSON file with video sources. It's configured in `index.html`, where you can provide your JSON file name:
```
<span id="json_file" hidden>files.json</span>
```
### Structure for JSON file

```

    "videos": [
        {
            "name": "FOLDER_NAME",
            "list": [

                }
            ]

## Gamepad controls 

Thumbstick up/down for zoom, left/right for rewind and fast forward.
If there are two connected controllers pressing trigger switches active controller.

## Troubleshooting

If videos or player can't be loaded make sure that this app files are owned by web server user (eg. www-data) and that web server user can read video and thumbnail files (eg. www-data is owner or permissions for others include read).
