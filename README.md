## Generating your own JSON file with video sources

```
<span id="json_file" hidden>files.json</span>
```

## Gamepad controls 

Thumbstick up/down for zoom, left/right for rewind and fast forward.
If there are two connected controllers pressing trigger switches active controller.

## Troubleshooting

If videos or player can't be loaded make sure that this app files are owned by web server user (eg. www-data) and that web server user can read video and thumbnail files (eg. www-data is owner or permissions for others include read).
